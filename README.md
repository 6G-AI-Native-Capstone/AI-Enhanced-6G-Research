# AI-Enhanced-6G-Research
This repository contains research, simulations, and insights focused on the development of AI-native architectures for 6G networks. The project explores the integration of artificial intelligence in next-generation communication systems, aiming to optimize performance, scalability, and adaptive learning capabilities in wireless networks.

Key areas of investigation include:

- Machine Learning (ML) for Channel Estimation, Equalization, and Symbol Demapping
- Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Constellation Design
- Simulations and validations using NVIDIA Sionna and MATLAB
- Real-world testing on the COSMOS 5G Testbed
- Contributions to the evolving landscape of 6G standards, use case studies, and experiments with real-world data are documented and version-controlled for collaborative research.
